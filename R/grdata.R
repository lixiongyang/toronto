#' Growth rate data (1960-1985)
#'
#' A dataset containing the Annualized GDP growth rate in the period 1960-1985 of different countries
#' and initial log GDP in 1960 with other attributes related to education, market efficiency, political stability, market openness and demographic characteristics.
#' In addition cross product term between log GDP in 1960 and education variables.
#' Because of missing obeservation, we have 70 observation of \code{lr} data.
